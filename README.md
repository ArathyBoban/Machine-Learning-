This assignment involves implementing supervised learning techniques on the Breast Cancer Dataset from sklearn. In this the key steps are:
Loading the dataset from sklearn.datasets then preprocessing by checking the missing values and performing feature data scaling using StandardScaler to ensure optimal performance for algorithms sensitive to feature magnitudes and splitting the dataset into training and testing.
Five supervised classification algorithms were implemented that is, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine(SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors(k-NN)
Then perform Evaluation Metric were accuracy was used to compare model performance and found out best and worst performing model.
